        year:'1922',
        description:'One of the threads running through Miro\'s work is his sense of something almost supernatural in the land, from which he felt he derived his vital energy in the same way that a tree does through its roots. Although he was born in Barcelona, from childhood he often visited Mallorca, his mother\'s home; Cornudella ( in the province of Tarragona), where his father was born; and later Montroig, where the family bought a farm. Miro\'s feelings toward these particular places are strongly present in a series of paintings done between 1918 and 1924. The paintings are often described as "detailist" because of the minute inventory of the rural world that the artist undertook in them. The diverse landscapes and objects always appear under intense, uniform light, as if illuminated by some mysterious energy of the earth. The Farm, painted on Miro\'s return from his first trip to Paris, culminated in this stage, which immediately preceded the decisive influence exerted on his work by Surrealism, beginning in 1924.',

        year:'1924-25',
        description:'When Miro moved into the studio of Pau Gargallo on the rue Blomet in Paris, he came in contact with the poets and artists belonging to a group that had arisen from Dadaism. In 1924, this became the Surrealist group centered on the poet Andre Breton. Miro was never an orthodox Surrealist. However, the movement legitimized the use of dreams and the subconscious as artistic raw material. It thus offered him the possibility of liberating his own pictorial style by allowing him freely to combine the earthly and the magical elements seen in his "detailist" period. Harlequin\'s Carnival is good example of this change. The world of the imagination and subconscious, rather than being an end in itself, was for Miro a way of giving shape in his paintings to his lived experiences and his memories. Harlequin\'s Carnival is seen by art critics as an account of the human subconscious mind. It is considered the highest point in Miro\'s personal surrealist style. Along with Persistence of Memory by Salvador Dali, Harlequin\'s Carnival has become the most iconic image of the Surrealism Movement.',

        year:'1961',
        description:"Miro once said: In my opinion, mastering freedom means mastering simplicity. Then, at most, a line, a color, is enough to make the picture. The Singing Fish is instantly recognizable as the work of Miro, combining highly abstract shapes to represent the artist's imagination. The key focal point in this painting is the head of the fish which looks out to the top left of the canvas, with its eye represented by two abstract circles. The Singing Fish is characterized by the use of a few pure tones (namely black and red), big simple forms and exceptional laconism in combination with the energy of poetic expression. This painting has a childlike simplicity and playfulness to it. Miro sought essential pictorial vocabulary in primitive sources, particularly prehistoric cave paintings of his native Spain. He used signs and symbols, composed of basic linear ingredients. ",

        year:'1924',
        description:'Only two years after he painted The Farm, Miró was spending more time back in Catalonia, trying out ways to distill the essence of his Catalan identity still further. He had become friends in Paris with André Breton, finding his once longed-for Surrealism. Surrealism, an artistic response to the power of dreams and the subconscious, was only a brief obsession for Miró but its ideas informed his painting of the mid-1920s, and his methods thereafter. "Every idea has to develop in my unconscious, and sometimes it takes years... The starting point is absolutely irrational, sudden and unconscious: I start off blindly..."        The compulsive detailing of his earlier painting had by the time of The Hunter become a kind of playful shorthand. He had a powerful sense of the emptiness of his remembered landscape, animated only momentarily by human action; life becomes explicable as a diagrammatic series of gestures and relationships, "the underlying magic", as Miró described it, and he developed a way of painting that seemed to respond to those energies. He was in search of the essence of things. In Catalan Landscape, 1924, his Catalan peasant alter ego is captured simultaneously in the act of shooting a rabbit for his cooking pot and fishing for a sardine for his barbecue.',

        image:'https://www.joan-miro.net/images/paintings/dutch-interior-i.jpg',
        year:'1928',
        description: 'In the summer of 1928 made his first trip to the Netherlands to see paintings by his beloved Dutch Golden Age masters, Rembrandt and Johannes Vermeer. "I loved that way the Dutch painters have of bringing out minute details like specks of dust and concentrating attention on a tiny spark in the darkness," Miro once remarked. "This is where their great power to fascinate lies."        Dutch Interior I is based on a seventeenth-century painting by Hendrick Martensz Sorgh depicting a lute player in a domestic interior. Miro bought a postcard reproduction of the work at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam a few months prior to beginning his painting.        Joan Miro and his contemporaries were encouraged by the doctrines of Sigmund Freud to make extensive experiments in deliberately suspending conscious control in order to release an unhindered flow of unconscious thought. They actually influenced states of hallucination, risking madness in order to capture the shapes and figures on paper during these states.       Miro\'s Dutch Interior I shows the very basic form of a man playing a guitar. He is the main focus with a dog, cat, pictures on the wall, and a window that the man is leaned up against. The man\'s body is a huge white blob with no definite separation to any body part. Starting from the top of the body, the head has a red circle at the top that represents the brain and holds the eyes and mouth. The eyes are two bird-like figures that face each other while the mouth is another bird-like figure that has white teeth coming from all directions. The ears are less recognizable: the right has the most ear-like shape while the left ear resembles an antenna. The left side has the same arm, although the hand is just a triangle. The white man figure has one leg that comes down his body but two feet that are sitting out from his body.',

        year:'1926',
        description:'From 1925 to 1928, under the influence of the Dadaists, Surrealists, and Paul Klee, Miró painted "dream pictures" and "imaginary landscapes" in which the linear configurations and patches of colour look almost as though they were set down randomly, as in The Policeman (1925). In paintings such as Dog Barking at the Moon, he rendered figures of animals and humans as indeterminate forms. Miró signed the manifesto of the Surrealist movement in 1924, and the members of the group respected him for the way he portrayed the realm of unconscious experience. The poet André Breton, the chief spokesman of Surrealism, stated that Miró was "the most Surrealist of us all."        In this sparse landscape, a ladder reaches up toward the black night sky. Nearby, a colorful dog stands on the brown earth, looking up to the half moon and bird above him. The bright colors and humorous subject matter create a fun, playful mood. The title of the painting, Dog Barking at the Moon, adds to this lighthearted feeling. However, the dark background and the vast empty spaces between the dog, ladder, and moon also produce a sense of loneliness and mystery.        Although he spent each winter in Paris, Joan Miró found inspiration for his art in his home in Catalonia, Spain, where he made sketches on his family farm. He based many of his paintings on these drawings and his memories of the farm, including this one.',

        year:'1953',
        description:'The Smile of the Flamboyant Wings, 1953 is the first in a series of similarly impulsive paintings. Some even feature Miro\'s handprints - a pleading gesture for which he derived his inspiration from pre-historic cave drawings. The use of materials and gestures became increasingly important factors in Miro\'s works. For a while he devoted himself exclusively to ceramics and developed some new techniques together with Artigas. It was with great energy that Miro subsequently took up painting again in 1960. With his new large-format paintings he picked up the thread of his series of pictures of 1953/54, while at the same time developing them further in the direction of poetic sensitivity.       Is not a similar striving after abstraction, after the dissolution of matter and the rational organization of the composition, manifest in the early works of Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky? In Kandinsky\'s case, it sprang from the desire to realize the absolute expressive potential of colours and their interrelationships; in Klee\'s, the aim was to uncover the mystery of a phenomenon or a form. Miro followed a third route. He was concerned to force the "effective reality of his surroundings to reveal itself even more vividly in a picture. He liked to feel he was on the way towards a new kind of pictorial reality - Cubism encouraged him, but his most profound purpose lay beyond them; he was more attracted by synthesis than by analysis.',

        year:'1960',
        description:'The art and culture of Joan Miró\'s native Catalonia were powerful forces in his painting and are reflected in both the playful effervescence and the dramatic intensity of his radical forms. Added to this inspiration were the influences he was exposed to in Paris: the poetry of the Parisian symbolists and surrealists, and the example of Paul Klee and the structural discipline of the cubists. This confluence nurtured a singular style at once earthy and spiritual, sensual and ethereal, but universal in expression. For Miró, this aspect was all important; he felt that painting ought "to rediscover the sources of human feeling."        Further influences had come to play upon the restless imagination of Miró by the 1940s, when his preoccupation with music and with the nocturnal sky brought a lasting sense of mystery and contemplative awe to his work. Miró\'s illustrations for Paul Eluard\'s poems, for which he was inspired by a Japanese woodcut artist, may have contributed to the calligraphic effect of the heavy black "signs proliferating in his imagery." A new interest in poetic titles emerged in the late 1940s, a lyric suggestiveness possibly inspired by illustrations for writings of Eluard and Tzara. Several works from 1948 share the theme and motifs of this painting. In addition, Miró had been overwhelmed by the urban scene of New York, where he had reestablished contact with Alexander Calder, Yves Tanguy, Marcel Duchamp, and had met Jackson Pollock. In fact, the raw mien of abstract expressionism may have been a source for the renewed excitement with materials that he referred to in an interview in the late 1940s, given shortly before executing The Red Sun.',

        year:'1960',
        description: 'Joan Miro experimented with the use of simple, exposed lines in his compositions. He held a particular reverence for the sun, moon, and stars, which determined the day and night, the light and absence of light, in our everyday lives. Though he was interested in the modernism of skyscrapers and man-made structures, he was fascinated by the drawings of cave men and human ancestors and their artistic responses to the power of the natural world.      In this painting Miro shows the world of his images in a very cheerful vein. Hovering in the top half of the picture, there are his usual escape ladders leading into heaven - symbols of the artist\'s relationship with the powers of creation. In the middle there is a large grey figure which that seems to be grasping at the ladders. Two enormous claws are bent upwards, and the animal-like face is turned towards the other figure on the left, whose head is balanced on a pointed pole. This nocturnal painting shows a cheerfully musical and easy-going playfulness.',

        description:'Miro\' had settled with his family in the small town of Varengeville on the coast of Normandy in 1939, and he would remain there until the advance of the German army made him decide to return to Spain the following year. A series of twenty-three small works on paper, painted in 1940 and 1941 and known as the Constellations, captures both his desire to escape a hostile reality and his response to the landscape and light of Normandy, so different from his usual Mediterranean surroundings. The sky and stars are the leitmotifs of this series. A tangle of lines and small, colored ideograms suggesting birds, allegorical characters, stars, and animals enlivens a vivid, textured surface. This imagery of the heavens led the painter to expand his sense of pictorial space. Despite their small format, these works look ahead to the system of organization of the large canvases, and many of the smaller ones, after 1941.        In Women Encircled by the Flight of a Bird, the starts, each represented by two triangles placed tip to tip, and the successive positions of the bird surround the women and extend to the edges of the painting, weaving a fabric of lines and shapes that organizes the entire surface of the picture.',

        description:'The Skiing Lesson belongs to a series of condensed, narrative configurations and is less poetic and cosmological in character than other paintings of the 1960s. Set against a semi-transparent, milky-white surface, which still bears a number of white spots (a feature that may have contributed to the title), there are a number of symbols and colours. It does not take long to discern a large configuration in the right half of the painting which, in turn, seems to be inextricably linked to other patterns and surrounding shapes. It is as if, quite unintentionally and playfully, Miro had started from a centre and then generated more and more shapes and colours, sending them adrift into the space of his picture, so that they did not add up to a cogent composition until they had found their place within the general context. The colours, too, seem to have their starting point in a centre (belonging to the configuration on the right) - at least so far as their intensity is concerned. The symmetrical correspondences between the colourful areas, the contrapuntal relationships between light and dark, hot and cold as well as the contrasts of quantity and quality make this painting a masterpiece of colour.',

        year:'1968',
        description:'The Gold of the Azure, 1967 has a wonderfully poetic quality about it, reminiscent of Asian art. Set against a light yellow surface, with a few white gaps to allow the canvas to "breathe", a number of stars and lines - as fine as hair - have been distributed, as well as some sombre, black dots, pardy connected by some very fine lines.        A huge black sweeping movement lunges into the blue shape on the right. This shape, however, has not been painted on the yellow surface - which would have given it a distinct tinge of green - but has been inserted into an oval gap on the white canvas. The red dot in the top left corner has been painted in the same way. Thus these two colours keep their balance against the strong forcefulness of the yellow. A tiny green spot hovers above the blue oval, demonstrating a different method of painting - a gentle merging into the paint while it was still wet so that a blurred effect could be achieved. Furthermore, the blue shape has been painted with the circling movements of a semi-dry paintbrush so that the white surface has remained faintly visible and is particularly in evidence around the edge. The painting refuses to yield to any further description of its content or to any fixed interpretation. Its poetic effect is dependent on the balance of its colors, the composition of symbols as well as its complex structure as regards artistic techniques. It is from the artistic means alone that Miro developed a "content", without, however, creating a totally abstract painting. In his pictures of the 1960s Miro continued to develop his symbolic language with increasing elementary force and colorfulness.',

His international career began to unfold at his exhibition in New York in 1941. the exhibition brought his fame to the United States at the moment when his pictorial vocabulary, which had been taking shape since the twenties, had matured into a unique language of his own. In the Constellations, he made the whole of the painting into a single, unified surface, integrating the figure with the background. Miro\'s very personal vocabulary of symbols was perfected by 1945. His paintings from this period are especially notable for their treatment of the background. The color of the background permeated the texture of the surface it is painted on, turning the field of color itself into a pictorial structure.',

        year:'1925',
        description:'Miro\'s Dancer of 1925 is one of his sparsest but at the same time most poetic pictures. Having primed the canvas with brown paint, the artist then applied a layer of ultramarine blue in such a way that the brown color was still visible in the form of an edge. The blue layer was added in broad, rapid movements, leaving spots and traces of the paintbrush to indicate the sweeping movements of the painter\'s hand.        Movement is also indicated by the blue lines that have been added to the blue surface on the left. There are dotted circles which add up to a surging spiral, and the impression of movement is further enhanced by a wavy line at the top. The direction of the dance is indicated by a straight, uninterrupted top-to-bottom line. The Dancer herself, on the right, has been indicated quite wittily: a ball-shaped head, modeled in light and dark shades, linked by a thin line to a flashy, red heart, with symbolic genitals attached to its tip. The whirling feet seem like stylized notes and may have a musical meaning. In a letter to the art collector Rosengart, who now owns the picture, Miro describes how he came to paint it. The idea first came to him when he was spending his Christmas holiday in Barcelona, where he watched a dancer at a bar called Eden Concert which was quite well-known at the time. Having drafted a few small sketches, he set to work as soon as he was back at his studio in Rue Blomet, Paris. Miro himself was very fond of this painting which marked the beginning of an important phase in his development as an artist.',
